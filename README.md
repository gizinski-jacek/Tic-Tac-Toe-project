2021.04.26  Initial files setup.

2021.05.01  Messed up and forgot doing pushes to github. Pretty bad personal week. Anyway, wrote most of JS code but I encapsulated everything in one single big module. Restructured it today and fixed other stuff and made the code less static. Left old piece of code at the bottom so there is at least some history from my first attempt. Will delete it later.
